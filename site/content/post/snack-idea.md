if we go without eating for a long time in a day, we tend to overeat when we have our next meal. However, if we snack throughout the day, or have snacks between meals, it helps to curb the appetite and you will feel satiated all day long.

Just remember to snack on the right things with balanced proportions, choose healthy alternatives that are enriched with nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. 

Remember, a diet filled with snacks can be a guilty pleasure or a nutritional powerhouse – it completely depends on what snacks you choose.

At Wonder Food Mart, we aim to bring you healthy nutrient-dense food options that you can incorporate in your daily diet routine and embark on this beautiful journey of being your healthy self.

And here are 4 healthy snacks that are enriched with all the vital nutrients and are incredibly tasty too.



1. SHRIHIT FOX NUTS (Makhanas)

A wholesome alternative to keep those hunger pangs away!

This healthy snack is absolutely gluten-free. Enriched with strong nutrient contents, they offer a rich source of fiber, protein, and magnesium and support weight loss. Just a bowl of roasted makhanas peppered with some salt will provide you with instant energy and help you keep going through the day. 

Whether you want to satisfy your sweet tooth or your mid-day cravings, makhanas are tasty to munch on.



2. SHRIHIT AMLA CANDY 

Do you have a sweet tooth and cravings for processed candy bars but also want to stick to a balanced diet? 

 We know it’s obvious, if healthy food doesn’t taste good, no one can sustain such a diet for a long period. At the same time, if you continue to have processed candy bars loaded with sugar and additives, they can harm your health.

But what could be more satisfying and rewarding if you can find healthy alternatives without having to compromise on your sweet cravings?

Shrihit Amla Candy is a nutritious healthy treat made with the goodness of Amla, a miracle fruit that is a powerhouse of nutrients. It’s a natural source of Vitamin C, a powerhouse of antioxidants, and is the most efficient immunity booster. It is widely known as an elixir of life as it offers a myriad of health benefits.  

If the bitter taste of raw amla was refraining from adding amla in your diet, this candy version can be the best way to include this wonder fruit in your diet.

The perfect blend of the sweet and sour taste of  SHRIHIT AMLA CANDY candy will be a delightful treat to munch on and will give a healthy boost to your diet.




3. SHRIHIT MUNAKKA

One of the reasons why adding healthy snacks in our diet is sustainable is that they are not only incredibly filling but also helps to maintain a healthy weight and even lose weight.

Munakka is an ideal nutritious and hearty snack. Filled with high levels of antioxidants, it is highly effective in building immunity levels. It is rich in dietary fiber and soluble fiber that helps to aid digestion as well as improve cholesterol levels in the body. It is extremely beneficial for stomach ailments as well. Being an excellent source of carbohydrates, it’s a natural energy booster. Rich in essential vitamins and minerals, a handful of munakka can help to maintain energy levels in the body.

It's an excellent snack for people with hypertension and type- 2 diabetes as it helps to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and is packed with natural sugar like fructose.

So, next time if you have the urge to indulge in a sweet snack and satisfy your hunger pangs, you know just a handful of Shirihit Munakka will be an ideal pick.
