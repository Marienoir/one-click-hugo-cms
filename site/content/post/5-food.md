According to experts, most fruits and vegetables do better outside the fridge. Below we will be listing out some foods that are best preserved outside the refrigerator.

## 1. Tomato

Tomatoes only belong in the fridge once they’ve started to ripen and as a way to keep them fresh. They fare better away from the cold but can be stored in the crisper when they reach their ripeness. When not ripe, tomatoes are best kept out of the fridge where they can ripen

## 2. Bread

Storing bread in the fridge might seem like a way to keep it fresher longer, but this isn’t actually the case; instead, it makes it get stale faster. so the best way to get the best out of your loaf of bread is to keep it in a cool dry place and try as much as possible to finish it up on time.

## 3. Potatoes

If you want to keep the flavour of potatoes longer, don’t store them in the fridge, because while the cold can help with freshness, this will also affect how they taste when it comes to cooking. The best way to store them is in a cool dark place like the bottom of the pantry. For better results, remove potatoes from plastic packaging before storing them.

## 4. Coffee

If you love your coffee fresh then it will be best for you to store your favourite brand in the cupboard rather than in the cool confines of the refrigerator, because if coffee is stored in a fridge, the condensation may affect its flavour.

## 5. Spreads

When it comes to storing spreads in the fridge, it’s best to make sure you check the label first for instructions. Spreads that are high in salt like peanut butter are well-preserved so refrigeration isn’t necessary. But With things like jams, it’s wise to because they are prone to mould development over time.
