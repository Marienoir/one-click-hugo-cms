        However, at Fresh-Mart, we have been able to solve this problem by
        selling fresh products during harvest and shortly thereafter
        processing the rest to meet demand during the rest of the year

        As technology improved and consumer incomes increased, it became possible to provide fresh produce year-round. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        Consumers often shy away from purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables because they don't know how to prepare and cook them. Vegetable and fruit marketing professionals working for produce suppliers, as well as retailers, can take the initiative in educating consumers on different ways to prepare their produce and incorporate vegetables and fruits into their daily and weekly meal plans.

    For many decades, nutritionists and other health professionals have tried to get consumers to consume more fresh produce. Fruits and vegetables are produced seasonally, but the market requires products throughout the year.

  heading: Quality Is the Key 
  description: >
    Price and quality are synonymous in fruit and vegetable production. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to know what is meant by "high quality" and quality judgment often varies from year to year.
    
     We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the fruits and vegetables, farmers and the local environment.
